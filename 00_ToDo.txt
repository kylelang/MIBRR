2016-NOV-05:
-Remove intercept regularization option -- DONE
-Use FIML to get means for centering -- DONE (and reverted)
-- FIML will be cumbsersome/infeasible when P > N
-- I tried implmenting an imputation-based solution
--- Don't know if this worked, may be a cause of the poor performance that we
--- need to track down.

2016-NOV-07:
- Check that we didn't break anything when moving to the new way of indexing
- missing data
-- The results are looking dubious--we need to find out why
--- The initial missing data treatment is a prime suspect
--- As is the new indexing method and potential problems with the post-
--- processing that it may have induced
- If we can get a stable version running, we need to start some simulations
- before doing any more development work.
