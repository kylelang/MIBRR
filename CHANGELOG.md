# Change Log
All notable changes to the **mibrr** project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog][kacl], and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning][sv].

NOTE: As of version 0.0.0.9000, I am returning to this project after
approximately 2.5 years away because I was unable to devote any attention to
this project during my postdoc. All initial development, therefore, is largely
undocumented.
