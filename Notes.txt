- We should include an intercept.
-- If we center Y and don't estimate an intercept, we assume no uncertainty in
   the center point.
-- Y's center will be estimated from the observed data, so we should assume some
   uncertainty.

- To incorportate a non-trivial intercept we need to:	
1) Leave Y in its raw form	
2) Sample an intercept as alpha ~ N(Y_bar, sqrt(simga^2 / N))
3) Incorporate the intercept offset when computing the SSE for sigma^2's update
4) Don't incorporate the intercept when updating Tau (we don't want to penalize
   the intercept).

- Most software back-transforms the parameter samples to undo the scaling of X.
-- We don't do that, so we should be happy if our predictions match theirs; our
   parameter samples won't.

- When generating our predictions, we must standardize the test set predictors.
-- For BEN and BL, we should also back-transform the parameter samples (then we
   won't need to standardize the test-set predictors).
-- As long as predictors and test-set match, standardization-wise, we don't need
   to worry about back-transforming parameters for imputation purposes.
