- We need to standardize X; we can't avoid it
-- The shrinkage penalizes the coefficients according to their magnitude
-- If the coefficients are on very different scales, the relative penalization
   will be meaningless
-- The way we treat the missing on auxiliary variables may cause problems
--- The auxiliaries will not be imputed as part of the Gibbs sampling
--- Their initial imputation will affect the means used for on-the-fly centering
--- If these mean estimates are very bad, they will probably bias the intercept
    samples and, consequently, the centers of the imputations' distributions

- We should include an intercept.
-- Without an intercept, imputations for observations at X's mean will be
   constant zeros (since X is mean centered).

- To incorportate a non-trivial intercept we need to:	
1) Leave Y in its raw form	
2) Sample an intercept as alpha ~ N(Y_bar, sqrt(simga^2 / N))
3) Incorporate the intercept offset when computing the SSE for sigma^2's update
4) Don't incorporate the intercept when updating Tau (we don't want to penalize
   the intercept).

- Most software back-transforms the parameter samples to undo the scaling of X.
-- We don't do that, so we should be happy if our predictions match theirs; our
   parameter samples won't.

- When generating our predictions, we must standardize the test set predictors.
-- For BEN and BL, we should also back-transform the parameter samples (then we
   won't need to standardize the test-set predictors).
-- As long as predictors and test-set match, standardization-wise, we don't need
   to worry about back-transforming parameters for imputation purposes.
-- To back transform our slopes, we divide them by SD_X
-- To back transform the intercept, we subtract X_bar %*% Beta_raw from the
   standardized intercept

- We should back-transform the parameters before generating the predictions.
-- If we standardize the predictors on-the-fly, the centering/scaling won't
   exactly match those used when estimating the coefficients
-- Alternatively, we can scale the "test set" predictors using the moments of
   the "training set" used to estimate the imputation model
