# Notes on the process of adding more chains

## Last Updated: 2019-12-11


## ToDo:
- QC each exported function
- Update the 'postPredict' and 'ppCheck' functions to work with the new setup
- Get the package to compile
- Check the performance against the old single chain version
- Update documentation

## Status:
- MCEM for MIBEN, MIBL, BEN, and BL run
  - May not be giving valid results; need to QC
  - Park and Casella (2008) and Li and Lin (2010) results are replicated by BL 
	and BEN.
- Full Bayes runs for MIBEN and MIBL
- vanilla runs
