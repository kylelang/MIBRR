# Notes on the process of adding more chains

## Last Updated: 2019-12-11


## ToDo:
- QC each exported function
- Update the parameter retrieval and prediction functions to work with the new 
  setup
- Get the package to compile
- Check the performance against the old single chain version

## Status:
- MCEM for MIBEN, MIBL, BEN, and BL run
  - May not be giving valid results; need to QC
- Fully Bayesian estimation breaks for everyone
