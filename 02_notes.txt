- "classic mode" calls version 2 of all the class definitions
-- This version appears to regularize the intercept

- Version 1 of the class definitions offers the option to regularize the intercepts

- Maybe the problems with installing on the cluster are because the TTU cluster runs CentOS???

*** 2016-NOV-05 ***
- The most recent branch is "moreControl"

- MibrrData2 returns predictor matrices that do not include a constant columns

- MibbrGibbs2 treats the intercept and slope components seperatly

- MibrrGibbs absorbs the intercept into the predictor matrix and avoid regularizing by setting _tau[0, 0] = 0
